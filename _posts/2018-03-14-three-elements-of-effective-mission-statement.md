Developing the mission statement and vision statement plays a significant role in company development. These two statements enable your organization to get the ball rolling. Therefore, it's essential to assure your document comprises valuable characteristics which include:

## Three Elements of an Effective Statement

An *effective mission statement* consists of 3 essential components:

1. Key market—which refers to the customers your organization is pursuing (target audience).
2. Contribution—the product or service your organization is offering
3. Distinction—how is your product(s) or services different from your competitors. Why should customers choose to purchase your products as opposed to others?

Your statement is an informative document that summarizes your organization’s business goals. It outlines your plan to accomplish distinctive variants of business & marketing goals. For this purpose, it's important to identify and define your geographic scope of operations, core technologies, and core capabilities.

### 1. What the Company Does & How You Do It

The purpose of the mission statement is to serve as an organization's chief aim or agenda. This document is an emotional declaration that expresses the business. It boldly defines organizational objectives and a clear, inspirational manner. In such a manner, it influences employees and the customers.

For example, Facebook's mission statement is "To give the people the power to share and make the world more open and connected".

As you can see, this statement clearly states what Facebook does and how they do it. This statement also engages and inspires the audience. It states "give the people the power"!

### 2. Who the Company Does It For

You should write every mission statement for customers and employees. Therefore, before you develop this document, you must identify your target audience.

The purpose of the *mission statement* is to tell customers why they should do business with you. It should also define the fundamental purpose of your organization while addressing your employees and your target market customers. This is essential because you should structure this document to inspire both the customer and employee.

Last but not least, the statement should summarize the company's objectives and goals. A typical statement is anywhere from 1 to 3 sentences, at most a paragraph.

### 3. Value the Company Brings to the Market

Last but not least, you must describe the value your company brings to the marketplace. It should describe elements that differentiate your brand or products from your competitors.

For example, Twitter's mission statement reads "To give everyone the power to create and share ideas instantly with no barriers".

Notice in this example, Twitter states "with no barriers". Now, of course, this statement makes Twitter different from its rivals. They allow their members to tweet most messages without a filter.
