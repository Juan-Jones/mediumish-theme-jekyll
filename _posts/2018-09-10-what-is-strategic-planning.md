9 elements of strategic planning:

1. Gap Analysis
2. Environmental Analysis
3. STEEPLE Analysis
4. Porter’s Five Force Analysis
5. Growth-Share Matrix
6. Scenario Planning
7. Guiding Policies
8. Balanced Scorecards/Strategy Map
9. Responsive Evaluation

### 1. Gap Analysis

The gap analysis compares your current performance with your potential or desired performance. With this analysis, you can determine if you have areas where you can improve. If you have a new product, gap analysis can also identify gaps in your market.

The gap analysis can be studied from different perspectives, which include: organization (e.g., human resources), business direction, business processes, and information technology.

This process helps you in the development process by clearing and structuring a plan for improvement. In other words, it helps you get the most out of your resources.

Usage Gap

The usage gap represents the current usage of all consumers vs the full potential of the entire market scope. Data calculation includes:

Existing Usage

Existing usage accounts for the total current market in which market shares are calculated. You can gather this information from marketing research, panel research, and Adhoc work.

Product Gap

The product gap or positioning gap identifies markets from which an organization is excluded on the basis of product(s) or service characteristics. Ordinarily, this happens when a market is segmented and the organization does not provide offerings in some segments or because the position of an organization itself excludes certain consumers.

### 2. Environmental Analysis

You should carry the environmental analysis out at an early stage of business development. Before you develop the mission statement and your vision statement. This is important because you need to identify your organization’s strengths and weaknesses before you develop a marketing plan.

In 1980, Porter wrote that the development of a competitive strategy should include four essential elements, which include:

1. Identify internal strengths and weaknesses.
2. Establish strong values and morals among leaders. (i.e., management and the board).
3. Discover the threats and opportunities within your marketplace.
4. Broader societal expectations.

The first two inputs are internal elements of your business, while the last two are external elements. As noted, the strategic planning framework is used to analyze both internally and externally. You can use the strategic planning framework to find internal and external strengths and weaknesses. Similarly, you can also use the strategic planning framework to identify internal and external opportunities and threats. Executing the opportunities and threats analysis will put your organization in a position to gain a sustainable competitive advantage.

### 3. STEEPLE Analysis

SPEEPLE is an acronym that stands for Social, Technological, Economic, Environmental, Political, Legal, and Ethics. The process enables you to identify business constraints and opportunities. It involves scanning the environmental components of your business environment.

Furthermore, the STEEPLE analysis is an extension of the PEST analysis and adds ethics. The term ethics refers to the code of ethics among your company’s representatives. The ethical component is designed to help you establish organizational values and morals.

### 4. Porter’s Five Forces Analysis

Porter’s five forces analysis is one of many strategic analysis tools and techniques. The process involves uncovering threats and opportunities within your marketplace by examining the business competition. You can gather vital information about your competitors, customers, and marketplaces.

Porter’s five forces - 1. The threat of new entrants. 2. Threat of substitute(s). 3. Bargaining power of customers. 4. Bargaining power of suppliers. 5. Competitive rivalry.

The process gives you the ability to discover indispensable internal data and information. More specifically, if your business is accomplishing the desired results. Consequently, you can identify the ingredients that serve value.

### 5. Growth-Share Matrix

The growth-share matrix (BCG) is a corporate planning tool that prompts businesses to determine where and how to invest. It helps organizations find growth opportunities by examining products.

This includes reviewing a product portfolio to determine whether you should keep or sell your products. In addition, the growth-share matrix helps you allocate resources used for brand marketing, product management, portfolio analysis, and organizational strategic management.

### 6. Scenario Planning

Scenario planning is analyzing futuristic possibilities for your organization. The evidence you gather allows you to test different scenarios. Consequently, you can predict changes and implement durable solutions.

As you may already know, it’s impossible to foresee what your business will look like in the future. You can create as many predictions as you’d like–but you’ll never truly know (factually) what the business will look like in the future.

Nevertheless, must guess or predict futuristic business components to determine your budget, strategy, and your marketing plan.

### 7. Guiding Policies

The guiding policy outlines your plan of action to overcome obstacles and function under pressure. It equips your company with strategic methods for maneuvering on unknown terrain or problem-solving. Accordingly, the guiding policy must include a series of coherent measures to guide your company in the event of market limitations.

### 8. Balanced Scorecards—Strategy Map

The scorecard focuses on your strategic agenda, portfolio initiatives, and financial/non-financial data. You can use these tools to measure, monitor, and control your strategy. Analyzing your performance makes it possible to determine the capacity of your organization.

Alternatively, a strategy map is a diagram you used to organize and document your strategic goals. The diagram provides a visual presentation of your organization’s goals. Your strategy map develops your goals and objectives.

### 9. Responsive Evaluation

Evaluation is a technique of strategic planning that’s rarely used. Responsive evaluation is the act of measuring the effectiveness of educational marketing programs. It entails contrasting your program activities, the uniqueness of your activities, and the social diversity of people.

One of the major benefits of the response evaluation is it allows organizations to identify a go-to strategy. By doing so, businesses increase their customer conversation rates.
