I’m sure you have heard this time and time again. But finding your passion is the key to developing a successful startup. It’s a proven fact, you increase your chances of success by working in an industry that you love. Finding your passion is a process that involves seeking something that you love to do. Better yet, an industry that suits you well. In the end, you'll understand it's easy to work when you're doing what you like to do.

### The Timing

Timing is everything. It can either make or break your business. Have you ever heard the saying "being in the right place at the right time"? If you have good timing, you can put your organization in a position to exploit opportunities. However, if you have bad timing, these opportunities will pass you by.

So, what's the solution for timing? Time is one of many elements that’s not on the side of people. Most business folks habitually say "there's not enough time in a day". However, you can't create more time. But you can choose to make the most of your time.

### The Team

To begin, everything starts with the leaders of the company. The executives and managers must stand on solid principles to attain startup success. Company leaders must have strong morals and values. The leaders must have a durable business philosophy.

Most seasoned executives understand they must build a solid team for their organization to grow. They understand the quote, “you’re only as good as your weakest link”? For this purpose, they will do whatever it takes to establish a team that can get the job done. Even if that means collaborating with business owners outside of the organization.

The representatives of your company must fulfill their professional duties and responsibilities efficiently. Of course, the obligations required depend on your company's industry.

At the end of the day, you must hire team members that don’t mind supporting your vision. Therefore, your team should have characteristics that resemble; dedication, selflessness, motivation, honesty, attentiveness, gratitude, extroverted, intelligence, ambition and other characteristics that fit your company motto.

### The Idea

Is there any such thing as a perfect business idea? Well, yes and no, there are good ideas and bad ideas. We all know a company that has a lucrative idea will shoot to the top. And companies with unhealthy ideas will struggle.

How can you find the right idea? The best way to go about this is by looking at matters from two perspectives, yours and the customers. This technique will give you a balanced perspective. The other method to determine the value of your idea involves getting feedback.

The most important factor to take into consideration is using your talent can increase your chances of startup success. Usually, when you use your talent, you have a better chance to stay grounded, which is important for the long haul.

Keep in mind, your idea plays a part in developing a successful startup. The idea is only as good as the team behind it.

### The Product and Service

It is important to build a product and service your target audience loves. Creating a valuable brand or product puts you in a position to succeed. Not only will customers purchase your products, but small and large retailers online and offline will also sell your product if it’s easily marketable. You can sell in bulk if you contract with retailers. During this period, you will start earning greater profits.

You’ll set yourself up for failure if you have a product that customers aren’t attracted to. Even if you love the product or brand, do something else or adding to what you have.

### The Funding

Most startups don't have enough capital to launch a startup. Hence, they must find resources to finance their business.

The financing process involves allocating resources to fund a business, as mentioned. These could be grants, small business loans, investments, crowdfunding, etc.

It’s important to understand that statistically many businesses have failed due to insufficient finances. They simply did not have adequate resources or finances to achieve the vision of their organization. Some companies have had the resources and ran out of money.

### The Skills

It’s important to understand there are several responsibilities that come with being an owner. There are two ways that you can go about this matter, either go to school for training or teach yourself.

Some individuals go to school to learn how to create and sustain an organization. You don't need a degree to start a business, but it can be of use.

If you’re hoping to teach yourself, it would be wise to start with a few personal adjustments. The first adjustment is changing the way you think. It may sound weird, but it’s important to change the way you think. Due to this fact, our thought process has a direct effect on our actions. The reason for changing our mindsets is simply to transform from thinking like a worker to thinking like an entrepreneur.

Teaching yourself means you must become a full-time student in your marketplace. You will need to learn each detail about managing an organization top to bottom, starting with a blueprint. In addition, you must develop strategic thinking skills.

### The Mindset

Initially altering your mindset to one of an entrepreneur may be initially uncomfortable, but in the long haul, you will be grateful for the decision you made. For this reason, think like a worker to think like an owner.

There’s a vast difference between the way workers and owners process how they earn income. Workers show up to complete whatever task(s) their boss or supervisor tells them to. Owners have more responsibilities, therefore they must complete missions or goals that they set. Therefore, as an owner, you must be goal-oriented.

All in all, you must think like those who are successful to become successful. Most entrepreneurs will tell you they studied others to get to where they are now.

### The Commitment

Most of us have heard the quote “patience is a virtue”. But, for launching a startup business, staying committed is the backbone to success.

It’s important to understand that “nothing happens overnight in business”. In most cases, the development phase will not go as planned. Therefore, you need to be prepared to adjust on the fly. More importantly, you must remain committed and grind it out.

It may take months, or even years, to achieve success. Nonetheless, you must stay focused and keep chipping away.

### The Determination

Your determination counts most when everything is said and done. If starting a business is something you want to do, do it. Nothing can stop a motivated individual. Therefore, it’s critical to make a commitment to launch a successful startup.

If you are developing your organization because you’re tired of your boss, that’s okay as well. However, you’ll need to dig deep and find something more purposeful in time.

## Why Most Newly Established Businesses Fail

Most entrepreneurs will tell you it's extremely difficult to launch a successful startup. And, of course, I agree. However, there are ways to increase your likelihood of success, like anything else you do. But before you can attain success, you need to know how to avoid failure. Therefore, you need to understand how and why startups fail.

So why do some fail and others succeed? Below are three major reasons why startups fail;

1. No market demand for products or services - According to statistics, the main reason most startups fail is because there's no market demand for the product or service being offered. The organization is in an industry with little or no customers. And of course, no customers equals no sales, no sales equals no revenue. Of course, you know the rest. Solution: There are two solutions for this issue. Market research and feedback. Many times, individuals are so excited about their new business and forget to cover the basics. Before you enter any market, you must understand the market.
2. Insufficient resources - Inadequate resources are the second most common problem for startups. These companies lack either start-up capital, investors, or time. Therefore, one of your top priorities should be to gather proper resources.
3. Don't possess suitable skills - Most business executives don't know what's needed to attain business success. And the ones that do know what they need don't have the skills that are required. For this purpose, make sure you and your team have what's needed to get your business off the ground. You need employees with strategic thinking skills that know how to market a business, effectively promote or advertise your business to your target audience and develop a solid business plan. You might need a lawyer to ensure that your company is legal, or to give you peace of mind.

There are several other reasons why startups fail. If you know what it takes to succeed and know how to avoid failure; you'll know what it takes to achieve startup success.

There are many factors that need to be considered before you even start a business. For example, check the market to determine if the company you want to start already exists. Or look at the business environment to see if it's crowded.
