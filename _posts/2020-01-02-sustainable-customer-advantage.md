Over this course of time, Myspace accomplished several accolades, including the largest social media network in the world, the most visited website in the world, the first global social network, etc.

While Myspace was reshaping the Internet, a group of Harvard students were cooking up a networking site (Facebook) that would change the world forever. Havard students Mark Zuckerberg, Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes developed a social media platform superior to its competitors. Hence, Facebook overtook Myspace in 2009 to become the largest social network to date, with nearly three billion active members.

In addition, your product(s) must hold value to attain success, therefore, you must produce products that are equal or better than items in your respective market.

The cost leadership strategy allows organizations to present competitive prices to the target market. Truthfully, it's one of the most effective methods to achieve a sustainable competitive advantage; because your organization can beat every price in the market.

For the most part, the cost leadership strategy is only effective for companies that have outperformed their competitors. Or businesses established for a while.

If someone has access to wholesalers, your business can benefit from the cost management strategy no matter what.
