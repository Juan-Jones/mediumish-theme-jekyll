## Social Video Marketing Best Practices

Are you attempting to increase brand awareness or drive traffic to your business? If you've answered yes to either of these questions, video marketing is the solution.

Why is social video marketing important? Video content is the most common resource for internet users. Statistics have shown, people would rather watch a video about a topic as opposed to reading. If you think about how the internet has strengthened over the years, you'll understand the importance of video content. YouTube is a prime example. Fifteen years ago, Google and Yahoo were the top search engines. Currently, YouTube is the second-largest search engine in the world.

Creating digital footage can reward organizations striving to grow. As you may already know, social video platforms have become the most dominant marketing resource for businesses. Aside from that, these platforms are the most popular resource for Internet users. So, there's no way companies can ignore video marketing as a growth solution. Below you'll find social video marketing tips and strategies that will help your business grow:

### Do Your Homework (Research)

Researching or doing your homework is critical. It gives you the ability to identify your goals to develop a plan for your video.

There are many reasons you need to do your homework, but I'll name a few. First, investigating the market gives you the ability to avoid pitfalls. You can identify threats and other elements that can prevent you from advancing. Second, doing your homework helps you to identify opportunities. You can accomplish this by scanning the video categories of your respective marketplace. Last, researching the market will help you discover trends.

#### Learn From Experts

Before launching your video, it is advisable to learn from experts. Or content creators, marketers, or influencers who have built a solid reputation in the market. You will be surprised how much you can learn from these individuals. There is no one better qualified to learn from than someone with experience.

Learning from the pros will help you save time. These men and women have done what you're trying to do. They can help you identify marketing solutions, increase market knowledge, and gain awareness. Ultimately, you can identify better strategies to market your videos.

### Develop a Plan For Your Video

Developing a plan for videos is a step often overlooked. Several individuals find themselves winging it. Of course, later on they regret it. You should develop a marketing plan with strategy any time you plan on achieving a business-related goal.

Planning begins with identifying your goals and your target audience. Once you've completed those steps, the next step involves figuring out the story you plan to tell the audience. Last but not least, set your advertising budget.

### Create Attractive Videos

Why do you need to create valuable material? To begin, you must create attractive videos to capture the audience's attention. As you may know, people tend to lose interest quickly when they're watching content that serves no value. Think of it from the user's perspective. Imagine watching a boring television channel or movie. Sooner or later, you'll turn the channel or watch a different movie when you lose interest.

In the same sense, this happens online when viewers are not satisfied. For this purpose, it is crucial to produce appealing content. A catchy title can capture the audience's attention. But to sustain their attention, you must have a purported expert level of knowledge of the topic.

One of the most common questions my subscribers ask is "how can I get my videos to be more attractive"? It's simple, find out the type of content your audience wants to view. This can be achieved through surveys, focus groups, or questions and answers. You can also attain a better understanding by studying content creators in your industry. Tips to create appealing videos include:

* Focusing on quality (sound, lighting, effects)
* Identifying social media video specs
* Using different camera angles

In the end, you need customers to subscribe, so they'll return to your platform.

### Utilize Video SEO

In the past, videos needed a certain percentage of keywords in the description and title to rank well. However, over the last few years, video SEO has changed. Nowadays, you must create videos for the user experience, rather than optimizing the search engine. Video optimization tips include:

* Categorizing your video.
* Strategically positioning keywords in your video description, title, and tags.
* Including your target keyword in the video file.
* Inserting a video transcript.
* Inserting a thumbnail that applies to your content

A video optimized for search engines can go a long way. It can appear in search results and get more click-throughs. Above all else, it can go viral. Here are a few resources you can use to identify keywords and key-phrases: Adwords, Wordtracker, and Wordstream.

### Center Videos Around Brand Building

As you may already know, building your brand is one of the most important aspects of marketing. Your brand reflects your business. By brand building, you can gain more subscribers, enhance your online presence and attract new customers. Brand building tips include:

* Be authentic
* Quality over quantity
* Focus on brand curation

### Upload Different Types of Videos

It's recommended to experiment with different videos. The type of video you choose to develop depends on your skills and experience. More importantly, your marketing goals. For example, if you are looking for customer feedback, webinars, interviews, or live streams would be the most appropriate types of videos. But if you're introducing a new product, you would be better off filming explainer videos, behind-the-scenes (BTS) films, or product demos. Types of social media videos include:

* 360 (VR)
* Animated Text Videos
* Announcements
* Augmented Reality (AR) Videos
* Brand Film
* Behind the Scenes (BTS)
* Breaking News/Trending
* Contest
* Customer-Centric Videos
* Explainer Videos
* Events
* Interviews (Q&A)
* Live Stream
* Personalized
* Presentation
* Product Demo
* Promos and Deals
* Tutorials/How-To's
* Stories Videos
* User-Generated Content (UGC)
* Vertical Videos
* Vlog
* Webinar

It's important to understand that most customers do not share the same interest. For example, 36% of the customers in your target market may be interested in explainer videos. Whereas the remaining 64% predominately watch live stream videos. So you'll need to develop different videos if you plan to reach all your customers.

### Keep Your Videos Short

Most people have a short attention span. Studies show the average attention span of a person is 8-9 seconds. This means you have a small window to capture the attention of your target audience.

Get Straight to the Point

Have you ever watched a video or went to a seminar to find the speaker beating around the bush? The speaker took an hour to deliver a message he/she could have delivered in 5 minutes.

### Establish Goals For Your Videos

Setting SMART (specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, time-bound) video marketing goals is a recipe for success. Establishing goals using these elements positions you to achieve your video marketing goals and objectives. Setting goals not only helps you reach your destination, but goals also provides you with something to measure.

Measure the Goals of Your Videos

It's important to measure the goals of your videos. Measuring your goals gives you the ability to identify elements that require work. Conversely, it allows you to recognize productive marketing campaigns.

Most social media platforms have analytics integrated. So measuring your goals should not be too difficult.

Before you _develop a marketing strategy_, it's important to understand your development purpose. By understanding the development purpose, you can develop a powerful strategy. To be more specific, comprehending a forward-looking approach helps you;

Why do you need to develop a marketing strategy? A well-developed marketing strategy enables you to determine the direction of your business. It also helps your organization discover opportunities, avoid risks, and maximize your earning potential. In addition, it helps you identify your vision and determine your mission. Consequently, you can provide clarity for your business and marketing goals. More importantly, you can outline solutions to achieve your company vision.
