## Types of Market Research

The following research techniques are essential for investigating small business matters; primary research, secondary research, quantitative research, qualitative research, exploratory research and descriptive research.

It's critical to perform this investigation prior to launching a company. More importantly, you must conduct research throughout the duration of your business. This will help you avoid pitfalls and uncover opportunities.

### Primary Research

Original research or primary research or is a research technique that involves collecting information firsthand. The aim of primary research is to gain knowledge by producing new information.

*Methods of Primary Market Research*:

* Surveys: One of the most common methods, surveys can be conducted online, over the phone, or in person. They help gather a large amount of data in a relatively short time.
* Interviews: These are more in-depth than surveys and can provide deeper insights into consumer behavior and preferences. They can be conducted one-on-one or in focus groups.
* Observations: This involves watching consumers in their natural environment to understand how they interact with a product or service.
* Experiments: These are used to test hypotheses in a controlled setting. For example, A/B testing in marketing campaigns.

Primary research provides data that is specific to the company’s needs, offering actionable insights.

### Secondary Research

Desk research or secondary market research involves analyzing data that has already been collected by other sources. This can include industry reports, academic journals, government publications, and competitive analysis.

*Sources of Secondary Market Research*:

* Industry Reports: These are comprehensive documents published by research firms, providing insights into market trends, size, and forecasts.
* Academic Journals: These provide theoretical and empirical research findings relevant to various industries.
* Government Publications: These include census data, economic indicators, and other statistics that are invaluable for market analysis.
* Competitive Analysis: Examining competitors' websites, annual reports, and press releases to understand their strategies and market position.

Secondary research is often more cost-effective and quicker to gather than primary research. It provides a broad understanding of the market and can help identify gaps that primary research can then explore in more detail.

### Quantitative Research

We need quantitative research for descriptive, correlational and experimental research. This methodological examination includes techniques like surveys, questionnaires, observations, and secondary research. It involves gathering intelligence by examining statistical, mathematical, and computational tactics.

* Descriptive research — determine a summary of your study variables
* Correlation research — examining relationships between your study variables
* Experimental research — investigation to determine if there's a cause-and-effect connection between variables

Quantitative research is important because it provides you with accurate insights that's logical, statistical and unbiased. The input collected from *quantitative research* gives you the opportunity to project results for larger or smaller populations.

### Qualitative Research

Qualitative research is a preliminary method of investigation. It entails conducting observations like interviews or focus groups to understand problems. The process involves approaching matters hoping to interpret phenomena in terms of the meaning people bring to you.

This method of investigation involves the collection of data through behavioral, observational, or verbal studies. It provides you with enough data to identify critical business elements that your organization should address.

### Combining Qualitative and Quantitative Research

Why Combine Both? Combining qualitative and quantitative research provides a more comprehensive understanding of the market. While qualitative research offers depth, quantitative research provides breadth. Together, they offer a balanced view.

*How to Combine Both?*

* Sequential Exploratory Strategy: Start with qualitative research to explore ideas and follow with quantitative research to test and validate these ideas.
* Sequential Explanatory Strategy: Begin with quantitative research to identify trends and follow up with qualitative research to understand the reasons behind these trends.
* Concurrent Triangulation Strategy: Conduct both types simultaneously and compare the results to get a holistic view.

### Exploratory Research

Exploration research is a preliminary method of investigation that allows researchers to identify effective research methods. It involves investigating problems to interpret the root of the problem that needs to be solved. Ordinarily, businesses use exploratory research to understand complex situations when problems are not clear.

Exploratory research is helpful because it allows researchers to be proactive. Subsequently, analysts can gain the most insights on the following topic through creativity.

### Descriptive Research

Descriptive research is used to define characteristics of a population or situation under study. This specific research model focuses on understanding the "what" question as opposed to how, when, or why.

We identify descriptive research as a quantitative method of investigation. However, qualitative research can also be used for descriptive purposes. Therefore, it is essential to focus on the careful development of research design to achieve precise and reliable results.
