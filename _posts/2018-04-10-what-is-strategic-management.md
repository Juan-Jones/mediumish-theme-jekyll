## Introduction to Strategic Management

Strategic management is a process that involves identifying and enforcing your organizational business strategy. It comprises specifying organizational objectives, developing policies, and devising plans to achieve objectives. More importantly, it helps you gather resources to pursue the plan.

The strategic management framework gives you the ability to analyze both internal and external disadvantages and advantages. It's a continuous process that can be re-evaluated and re-constructed.

In addition, it gives you the ability to evaluate your mission and strategic issues. Ultimately, you can strengthen your current business activities and determine the need for new programming.

## Strategic Management Processes

The strategic management process helps organizations increase awareness & competitiveness. It is one of a few frameworks that enable companies to attain sustainable success.

Imagine, for illustration, that you have an elaborate blueprint that provides instructions. Now imagine possessing the same blueprint, but this time there are no instructions. You can easily make mistakes without instructions. By the same token, you can easily navigate through the blueprint if you have directions. Similarly, without strategic management, it is easy for organizations to get off course.

As you may already know, the strategic management process involves examining the internal/external components of an organization. If you are considering a startup, the framework will help you achieve your business goals. This framework provides tools for scanning disadvantages and advantages.

## Pivotal Stages of Strategic Management

Briefly, the strategic management process helps you gather resources to tackle your marketing strategy. The allocation of these resources enables you to set the tone of your organization. More importantly, it supplies your representatives with a blueprint to carry out marketing goals and objectives. Pivotal stages of strategic management include:

* Initial analysis — initial analysis comprises examining the internal, external and remote environment
* Strategy formation — a complete diagnosis of opportunities and deciding how the business will compete
* Goal setting — identifying, examining and determining guiding policies, corporate and business objectives
* Strategy implementation — gathering resources, then determining how they will be used towards the strategy
* Establish structure — Defining day-to-day operations to gain an edge in the marketplace
* Strategic control and feedback — an ongoing process that involves scanning and reviewing strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats

All in all, the strategic management process is essential for growth and development. Therefore, it's essential to keep innovating as time goes by, so you don’t get left behind. You must continuously adapt to the environment.

### Strategy Formulation

Strategy formulation is a decision-making process that focuses on how the organization will compete. To illustrate: let's say competition in your market is competitive. Therefore, you perform a SWOT analysis and discover the price of your products is well above the market average. Of course, the next step would be to reassess and plan a competitive pricing strategy.

The two most common tools for this process are PESTLE and SWOT analysis. Addressing your strengths and weaknesses early on will enable you to be proactive. You can turn your organization’s disadvantages into strengths. By the same token, the political and environmental analysis will also help you avoid trials and tribulations.

### Initial Analysis

The initial analysis involves analyzing business environments in your market, which include; remote environment, external business environment, and internal business environment.

* Industry environment analysis - The industry environmental analysis involves examining elements in the industry. As an illustration, several companies began analyzing and exploiting social media channels early on. Consequently, these organizations could increase their revenue. Whereas, the organizations that failed to take advantage of these digital marketing channels were left behind. These companies either lost their business, or they’re still playing catch-up.
* Internal environment analysis - The internal environment refers to business components within the company. These are elements like the brand image, brand equity, company philosophy, value proposition, sources of income, and physical resources. Basically, anything associated with the company.
* Remote external environment analysis - The remote external environment refers to elements that exist beyond the business operating situation. These are factors that include political, environmental, social, technological, legal, and environmental.

Many companies fail to analyze their initial situation. Or they cannot investigate it consistently. However, it's important to identify where you're at to get to where you're going.

You must evaluate your company's resources after identifying your strengths and weaknesses. To be more specific, determine if the 4 P’s (price, product, promotion, place) of the marketing mix meet your organization’s financial goals.

### Strategy Formation

Strategy formation is a critical stage of strategic management. The strategy formation process is an ongoing process that involves assessing and re-assessing strategic techniques to gain an edge.

In the end, the aim of strategy formation is to identify and establish tactics to gain an advantage in your respective marketplace. Once you have gathered enough information to increase your competitiveness, setting goals to achieve these strategies would be the next step.

### Goal Setting

It’s vital for companies to stay up to date. Staying up to date is essential because it allows organizations to stay a step ahead of competitors. For this purpose, businesses must make goal setting a habit.

* Objectives (Business, Functional, Corporate) - Business objectives are measurable goals of a business plan. Functional objectives are elements that relate to business (e.g., financing, marketing, human resources, technology, operations) designed to support corporate objectives.
* Guiding policies - An approach to identify solutions for obstacles. A plan of action or activities to carry out guiding policies.
* Measures and scoreboards - To put it in perspective, the balanced scorecards and strategy maps measure your performance and success regarding your strategy.

Setting goals helps your organization add clarity to the mission and vision. It enables the organization to convert the company's mission and vision into organizational objectives. This provides the executives and managers with a target to reach.

### Strategy Implementation

The next phase of _strategic management_ is the implementation of the strategy. Strategy execution is perhaps the most pivotal phase of strategic management.

Strategy implementation helps you determine what resources are used towards your objectives. It involves identifying mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures. This process also involves identifying financial plans and budgets.

Establishing structure is essential for growth. The process involves defining components of your day-to-day operations. This includes establishing the structure of your leadership, communication, and incentives.

What is the formation of organizational structure? It is a system to define the hierarchy structure of company representatives. More specifically, a system to identify CEOs, CFOs, managers, board members, staff, etc.

As you may already know, business and technology will always change. Therefore, your organization must establish an organizational structure so your organization is grounded for the long haul. Your company must be prepared to adapt both internally and externally as time passes.

### Strategic Evaluation Control and Feedback

Many organizations neglect evaluation control and feedback. Or they fail to investigate it consistently. Strategy evaluation is as important as any other process. Evaluation allows your organization to identify both qualitative and quantitative data.

Control and feedback is a process that allows managers to determine if their team is achieving the goals established. These could be financial goals, production goals, or marketing goals.

Strategy monitoring is the last step of strategic management. This step helps you to increase your market position. This is a key component to developing or enhancing your growth strategy.

When writing your _business plan_, it's important to understand what material goes into the plan. Therefore, research should be your initial priority. Explore every aspect of your business. Especially if you're launching a startup and seeking to gain bank loans or investments.

Typically, banks or investors require a detailed plan illustrating how and when they will receive their return on investment (ROI).

However, even if your company doesn't need financing, _writing a business plan_ is still vital for success. It will help you identify market advantages, internal opportunities, weaknesses, and much more.
