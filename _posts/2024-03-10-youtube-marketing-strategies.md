### Create Unique Footage

Creating unique footage is probably the most important element of all. Original content is important for a few reasons.

Once you've gained enough subscribers, you can start slowing down. You can use the suspense strategy. Keep your fans in suspense, just like a movie waiting to hit the theater. But try not to wait too long to produce new content, otherwise, your fans might forget about you. But, when you finally decide to upload your clip, deliver mind-blowing footage, to make it worth the wait.

2. Give shots out to your active supporters by mentioning them by name on a live video or through a post.
3. Promote contests or giveaways to show followers' support as they support you.
