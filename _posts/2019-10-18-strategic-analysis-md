It’s a vital practice for companies looking to maintain a competitive edge and achieve long-term success.

## What is Strategic Analysis?

More importantly, these tools help you develop a better understanding of the 3 Cs (customer, competitor, company).

### Strategic Analysis Process

The process of strategic analysis usually takes place during the stages of strategic thinking and planning.

* Collecting data & information, e.g., (surveys, focus groups, interviews)
* Analyzing the effect of the 4 Ps (marketing mix) has on prospects and customers
* Addressing your findings productively will give you a competitive advantage

Strategic analysis is a central process for producing your marketing strategy. It supplies you with information that enables you to plan and implement your marketing goals and objectives.

Above all, you must conduct this analysis to identify strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities. This analysis contains both qualitative and quantitative analytical techniques that help you make better decisions. Ultimately, you can get the most out of your plan and strategy.

### Common Tools and Techniques

There are many tools and techniques that firms use to examine specific external & internal elements. The purpose of using these tools and techniques is to develop insight and data regarding external and internal environmental operations that focus on classifying potential futuristic opportunities, threats, and end goals.

Common tools and techniques of the strategic analysis:

* Environmental analysis — identifying external/internal factors that may impact the company
* Gap analysis — comparing the current performance and desired performance
* Market segmentation analysis — dividing target market/audience into groups and subgroups
* PEST/PESTLE analysis — examination of political, economic, socio-cultural, technological, legal, and environmental business components
* Situational analysis — external and internal investigation of a business environment to understand organizational capabilities
* SWOT analysis — identifying internal/external strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats
* Value chain analysis — strategic activities executed to deliver valuable products

Every firm is different, therefore each firm will use different tools and techniques to address its current state of affairs. For instance, a corporation that operates on an international scale may use an analytical technique known as the Herfindahl index to measure the size of their firm.

Likewise, a family business that operates locally would not benefit from using the Herfindahl index tool. Generally , the following factors determine the technique or tool a firm uses; condition or root of the problem, data availability, environmental problems, goals and objectives, motivation or time, and skill level of the analyst.
