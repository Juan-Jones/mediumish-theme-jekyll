Identifying customers within the *target market* or primary market is the most important element to be successful with any business. For starters, discovering your primary market enables your organization to identify high-yielding customers. In other words, you can identify leads and prospects that have an interest in your products or services.

In addition, this marketing technique helps your organization identify valuable leads and prospects and convert them into customers. In the long run, ensures the longevity of your company.

## How to Define Your Target Market

* Website analytics — There are several platforms that have their members analytical services (Google Analytics, Matomo Analytics, Hotjar, HubSpot).
* Social media analytics — There are several platforms that offer their members analytical services (YouTube analytics, LinkedIn analytics, Facebook analytics).

Identifying the target market or primary market is one of the top priorities for developing a successful marketing strategy. Your organization can’t sell products or services without customers.

## Purpose of Identifying the Target Market

It’s impossible for companies to survive without identifying the target market in the 21st century. To be honest, you must identify valuable customers for several reasons, but I'll name three.

Identifying your perfect customer is the primary purpose for identifying the target market. Most of us don't have money to waste. Attempting to target every customer would be a complete waste of time. Therefore, it’s essential to narrow down the list of customers to do business with. More specifically, customers are likely to purchase products and services.

Once you've identified your most valuable customers, you can begin targeting these individuals. But before you can begin targeting your perfect customer; you must understand what they need and expect. So the second reason for identifying your target market would be to understand customer expectations.

Lastly, recognizing your primary market gives you the ability to perfect your marketing mix. Understanding your primary market is crucial because seeing eye to eye with customers you’re targeting opens a window of opportunity to develop better products and services. Once you understand your customer's expectations, you can tailor your marketing mix to their needs and wants. In other words, you can either begin meeting or exceeding customer expectations.

The target market refers to the group of individuals in which an organization aims its marketing efforts and resources. This process helps businesses identify the perfect customer. Whereas, target marketing is a marketing technique used for pursuing customers. It involves concentrating your message or marketing campaign on a specific market. This process helps organizations find their perfect customer.
